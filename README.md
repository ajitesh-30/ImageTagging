# ImageTagging
Image Tagging Using CNN

1) We used the CNN architecture .(RELU activation function , 3 Convolution Layer , 2 Max Pooling Layer and 2 Dense Layer , A Dropout of 0.2 after each Dense Layer ).

2) The Categorical Cross Entropy Loss Function was used .

3) We extracted the HOG and the SIFT Features for Image .

4) We used the K Nearest Neighbor Technique and Support Vector Machine for Image Tagging both of which showed different results .
